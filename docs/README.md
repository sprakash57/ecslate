## What is Ecslate?

Ecslate is a desktop utility app to assist web developers. During our day to day work, we stumble upon situations where we need to just execute a piece of logic 
before including it into main codebase. Sometimes you need to convert or beautify JSON file. Or maybe you want to compare Text/JSON. These task are not mainstream but they consume your precious time. Surprisingly all the said task can be easily done over any web browser. But putting your data in the browser on some 3rd party websites is not always a good idea. Ecslate solve this by introducing slates where you can achieve all the task without ever going to the Browser. Right now it has slates that can execute code snippet, compare and format data.

## Features

Currently Ecslate supports limited number of functionality. Keep an eye on this space for new features in upcoming releases.

- Electron based application for long term support and reliability.
- Scribe and execute JavaScript logic in isolation.
- Beautify JSON and YAML files.
- Text/JSON based comparison with colored differences.
- Settings to refine user experience.

## Donate

Ecslate is an open-source project. I have initiated this as self-starter. But I thought, it would be really helpful to people like me to use the same tool 
that I use on day to day basis. It takes lots of effort and hard work to add new features, provide support and maintain at the same time. Please consider donating if you think docsify is helpful to you or that my work is valuable. Your support will keep me motivated to keep ecslate alive. I would be happy if you can -
