## Beautify

This will help in beautification and formatting of JSON or YAML files. Type/Paste your unformatted code in the left pane. There are couple of controls in the middle pane - Beautify, Reset and Type selection from top to bottom. Hover over them for details. Please note that type selection is important. If you want to format JSON, make sure JSON is selected from dropdown. Same goes for YAML.
